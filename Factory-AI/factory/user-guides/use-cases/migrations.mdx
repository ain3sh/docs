title: Code Migrations with Factory
description: Learn how to leverage Factory's AI capabilities to streamline and automate the process of migrating code between languages or frameworks
---

Code migrations can be complex and time-consuming, often requiring deep understanding of both the source and target languages or frameworks. Factory can significantly streamline this process by assisting with code analysis, conversion, and testing. This guide will walk you through how to effectively use Factory for code migration projects.

## Getting Started

Before beginning your code migration project with Factory, ensure you have:

1. Access to Factory

2. Your source code ready for migration

3. A clear understanding of your target language or framework

<Note>
  If you're new to Factory, refer to our [Quickstart Guide](/user-guides/get-started/quickstart) to set up your environment.
</Note>

## Importing Your Code

To leverage Factory's full potential for code migrations, you need to provide it with your source code. Connect to Bridge for access to local files, or connect to a remote workspace for access to any remote repository.

## Code Migration Workflow with Factory

### 1. Project Analysis

Start by asking Factory to analyze your project structure and identify potential migration challenges:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Overview Request">
    Ask Factory for a high-level overview of your project:

    "I've uploaded our project files. Can you analyze the structure and provide an overview of the main components, dependencies, and potential challenges for migrating from \[source language/framework] to \[target language/framework]?"
  </Step>

  <Step title="Dependency Analysis">
    Request a detailed look at project dependencies:

    "Please identify all external libraries and dependencies used in the project. For each, can you suggest equivalent libraries or approaches in our target language/framework?"
  </Step>

  <Step title="Complexity Assessment">
    Ask Factory to assess the complexity of the migration:

    "Based on your analysis, can you rate the complexity of migrating each component on a scale of 1-5? Please explain your reasoning and highlight any parts that might require special attention."
  </Step>
</Steps>

### 2. Migration Planning

Use Factory to help create a detailed migration plan:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Prioritization">
    Ask Factory to suggest a migration order:

    "Given the project structure and component dependencies, what order would you recommend for migrating the different parts of the application? Please provide a step-by-step migration plan."
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Time Estimation">
    Request time estimates for each part of the migration:

    "Based on the complexity assessment, can you provide rough time estimates for migrating each component? Please consider factors like code complexity, test coverage, and potential integration challenges."
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Risk Assessment">
    Ask Factory to identify potential risks:

    "What are the main risks in this migration project? For each risk, can you suggest mitigation strategies?"
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### 3. Code Conversion

Leverage Factory's code generation capabilities for the actual migration process:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Component Migration">
    Start with individual components:

    "Let's begin with migrating the \[component name]. Here's the source code. Can you convert this to \[target language/framework], maintaining the same functionality?"
  </Step>

  <Step title="Code Review">
    Ask Factory to explain its conversion process:

    "Can you walk me through the changes you made in this conversion? Why did you choose these specific implementations in the target language?"
  </Step>

  <Step title="Optimization">
    Request optimizations for the converted code:

    "Now that we have a working conversion, can you suggest any optimizations or improvements that leverage specific features of \[target language/framework]?"
  </Step>
</Steps>

### 4. Testing and Validation

Use Factory to help ensure the migrated code functions correctly:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Test Migration">
    Ask Factory to help migrate your tests:

    "Here are the unit tests for \[component name] in our source language. Can you convert these to equivalent tests in our target language/framework?"
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Test Coverage Analysis">
    Request an analysis of test coverage:

    "After migrating the tests, can you analyze our test coverage? Are there any areas where we should add additional tests to ensure the migrated code is functioning correctly?"
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Integration Testing">
    Seek advice on integration testing:

    "What approach would you recommend for integration testing our newly migrated components with the rest of the system? Can you provide a sample integration test?"
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Best Practices for Code Migrations with Factory

1. **Start Small**: Begin with smaller, less critical components to get familiar with the migration process before tackling core functionality.

2. **Maintain Consistency**: Ask Factory to adhere to the coding standards and patterns of your target language/framework.

3. **Incremental Migration**: For large projects, consider a gradual migration approach. Ask Factory how to set up a system where old and new code can coexist during the migration process.

4. **Continuous Validation**: Regularly ask Factory to review migrated code for consistency and adherence to best practices in the target language/framework.

5. **Document Changes**: Use Factory to help document significant changes, especially where the architecture or design patterns have been altered in the migration.

6. **Performance Comparison**: After migration, ask Factory to help you set up performance tests to compare the migrated code against the original.
