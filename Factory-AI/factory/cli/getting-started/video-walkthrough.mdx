### Creating a Custom Droid

[Learn more about custom droids →](/cli/configuration/custom-droids)

<Steps>
  <Step title="Choose Scope">
    Decide if the droid should be **project-level** (specific repository) or **personal** (available across all projects)
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Generation Method">
    Choose to create manually or generate with droid's help:
    
    ```
    I want a code review droid that checks for security issues and coding standards
    ```
    
    Droid will generate an appropriate description and configuration
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Configure Model">
    - **Inherit**: Use the same model as the parent session
    - **Specific Model**: Choose a dedicated model for this droid (e.g., use a reasoning model for complex analysis)
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Enable Tools">
    Select which tools and capabilities the droid should have access to
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Save & Edit">
    Confirm the configuration and optionally edit the details
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Example Use Cases

- **Code Review Droid** - Automated code reviews for pull requests
- **Documentation Droid** - Generates and maintains documentation
- **Test Generation Droid** - Creates comprehensive test suites
- **Security Audit Droid** - Scans for vulnerabilities and security issues

## MCP Integrations

Model Context Protocol (MCP) allows droid to integrate with external tools and data sources.

### Adding MCPs via CLI

Use the `/mcp add` command:

```bash
/mcp add
```

Then provide the MCP details:
- **Name**: Identifier for the MCP
- **Command**: Executable command (e.g., `npx`, `python`)
- **Args**: Command arguments
- **Environment Variables**: API keys and configuration

### Listing Configured MCPs

```bash
/mcp list
```

This shows all configured MCPs and their enabled/disabled status.

<Note>
  After adding or modifying MCPs, you may need to restart the CLI for changes to take effect.
</Note>

### Adding MCPs via Configuration File

You can also directly edit `~/.factory/mcp.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "filesystem": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem", "/path/to/directory"]
    },
    "github": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-github"],
      "env": {
        "GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN": "your-token-here"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Popular MCP Integrations

## Example Workflow: Spec Mode to Implementation

Here's a complete workflow demonstrating droid's capabilities:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Start in Spec Mode">
    Press `Shift + Tab` until you're in Spec mode
    
    ```
    Create an authentication system with GitHub and Google OAuth
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Review the Plan">
    Droid generates a detailed specification:
    - Architecture decisions
    - Files to create/modify
    - Dependencies needed
    - Implementation steps
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Iterate on the Spec">
    Refine the plan before implementation:
    
    ```
    Change the plan to only include Github auth and not Google auth
    ```
    
    Droid updates the specification accordingly
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Approve and Proceed">
    Once satisfied with the plan, proceed with High mode to implement
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Review Changes">
    Droid shows exactly what will change and waits for your approval
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
  Spec mode is especially powerful for complex features. It allows you to validate the approach before any code is written.
</Tip>
