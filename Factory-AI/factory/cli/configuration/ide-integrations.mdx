title: IDE Integrations
description: Run droid directly inside your editor for richer context and a smoother workflow.
---

Droid works great with any Integrated Development Environment (IDE) that has a terminal. Just run `droid`, and you're ready to go.

In addition, Droid provides a dedicated integration for Visual Studio Code (including popular forks like Cursor, Windsurf, and VSCodium). For JetBrains IDEs such as IntelliJ, PyCharm, Android Studio, WebStorm, PhpStorm, and GoLand, simply run `droid` inside the integrated terminal—no plugin is required.

## Features

- **Quick launch**: Use keyboard shortcuts to open Droid directly from your editor, or click the Droid button in the UI
- **Diff viewing**: Code changes can be displayed directly in the IDE diff viewer instead of the terminal
- **Selection context**: The current selection/tab in the IDE is automatically shared with Droid
- **File reference shortcuts**: Use keyboard shortcuts to insert file references
- **Diagnostic sharing**: Diagnostic errors (lint, syntax, etc.) from the IDE are automatically shared with Droid as you work

## Installation

### VS Code

To install Droid on VS Code and popular forks like Cursor, Windsurf, and VSCodium:

1. Open VS Code
2. Open the integrated terminal
3. Run `droid` - the extension will auto-install

<Note>
  You can install the [VS Code Extension
  here](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Factory.factory-vscode-extension).
</Note>

### JetBrains

Open the integrated terminal in your JetBrains IDE (IntelliJ, PyCharm, Android Studio, WebStorm, PhpStorm, or GoLand) and run `droid`. No additional plugin installation is necessary.

## Usage

### From your IDE

Run `droid` from your IDE's integrated terminal, and all features will be active.

## Troubleshooting

### VS Code extension not installing

- Ensure you're running Droid from VS Code's integrated terminal
- Ensure that the CLI corresponding to your IDE is installed:
  - For VS Code: `code` command should be available
  - For Cursor: `cursor` command should be available
  - For Windsurf: `windsurf` command should be available
  - For VSCodium: `codium` command should be available
  - If not installed, use `Cmd+Shift+P` (Mac) or `Ctrl+Shift+P` (Windows/Linux) and search for "Shell Command: Install 'code' command in PATH" (or the equivalent for your IDE)
- Check that VS Code has permission to install extensions

### JetBrains terminal issues

- Ensure you're running Droid from the project root directory
- Use the integrated terminal inside the IDE rather than an external shell
- Completely restart the IDE if terminal state issues persist

### ESC key configuration

If the ESC key doesn't interrupt Droid operations in JetBrains terminals:

1. Go to Settings → Tools → Terminal
2. Either:
   - Uncheck "Move focus to the editor with Escape", or
   - Click "Configure terminal keybindings" and delete the "Switch focus to Editor" shortcut
3. Apply the changes

This allows the ESC key to properly interrupt Droid operations.

| ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **"Editor integration disabled" message** | Verify the VS Code extension is installed or update `editorIntegration` to match your editor |
| CLI cannot find Node/Bun                  | Ensure the `droid` binary is on the PATH VS Code/JetBrains uses (restart after install)    |
| Missing file context                      | Save files; unsaved buffers older than 500 KB are skipped for performance                  |
| Stale diagnostics                         | Run **↻ Refresh Diagnostics** command (VS Code Command Palette)                            |
| VS Code terminal closes immediately       | Check your shell's startup scripts: they must not auto-exit                                |
| Network blocked in corporate proxy        | Configure proxy variables in settings or set `HTTP_PROXY`/`HTTPS_PROXY` env vars           |
