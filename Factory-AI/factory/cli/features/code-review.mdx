## Overview

The `/review` command provides an interactive workflow for analyzing code changes with AI-powered insights. It offers multiple review modes to fit different development scenarios—from reviewing uncommitted changes to analyzing full branches or specific commits.

When you run `/review`, droid guides you through selecting a review type, configuring parameters, and then performs a comprehensive analysis of your code changes based on industry-standard review guidelines.

## Quick start

<Steps>
  <Step title="Start the review flow">
    In an interactive droid session, type:
    ```bash
    /review
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Select a review type">
    Choose from four review presets:
    - **Review against a base branch** - PR-style review comparing your branch to a base branch
    - **Review uncommitted changes** - Analyze working directory changes (staged, unstaged, and untracked)
    - **Review a commit** - Examine a specific commit from history
    - **Custom review instructions** - Define your own review criteria
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure parameters">
    Depending on your selection:
    - For **base branch reviews**: Select the target branch (e.g., `main`, `develop`)
    - For **commit reviews**: Choose a commit from the interactive list
    - For **custom reviews**: Enter your review instructions
  </Step>

  <Step title="Review the findings">
    Droid analyzes the code changes and provides:
    - Prioritized findings with severity levels [P0-P3]
    - Specific file locations and line numbers
    - Suggested fixes with code suggestions
    - Overall assessment of the changes
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Review types

### Review against a base branch

Compare your current branch against a base branch (like a pull request review). This is ideal for pre-PR reviews or checking what changes would be merged.

**How it works:**
1. Select "Review against a base branch"
2. Choose your target base branch from the list (local and remote branches shown)
3. Droid finds the merge base and reviews the diff

**Use cases:**
- Pre-commit PR reviews
- Checking branch changes before creating a pull request
- Validating feature branch against main/develop

**Example workflow:**
```bash
> /review
# Select: Review against a base branch
# Choose: origin/main
# Droid reviews all changes that would be merged
```

### Review uncommitted changes

Analyze all current working directory changes—staged files, unstaged modifications, and untracked files.

**Use cases:**
- Quick sanity check before committing
- Reviewing work in progress
- Finding issues early in development

**Example workflow:**
```bash
> /review
# Select: Review uncommitted changes
# Droid immediately reviews all working directory changes
```

### Review a commit

Examine the changes introduced by a specific commit in your repository history.

**How it works:**
1. Select "Review a commit"
2. Browse commits with hash, message, author, and date
3. Select a commit to review

**Use cases:**
- Reviewing recent commits for issues
- Understanding changes in a specific commit
- Post-merge review of teammate's work

**Example workflow:**
```bash
> /review
# Select: Review a commit
# Browse and select: abc1234 - "Add user authentication"
# Droid reviews that specific commit's changes
```

### Custom review instructions

Define your own review criteria for specialized analysis.

**Use cases:**
- Security-focused reviews
- Performance analysis
- Checking specific coding standards
- Domain-specific validations

**Example workflow:**
```bash
> /review
# Select: Custom review instructions
# Enter: "Check for SQL injection vulnerabilities and ensure all database queries use parameterized statements"
# Droid performs a targeted security review
```

## Review guidelines

All code reviews follow a structured rubric designed to provide actionable, high-quality feedback:

### Severity levels

Reviews categorize findings using priority levels:

- **[P0]** - Critical issues blocking release or operations
- **[P1]** - Urgent issues that should be addressed in the next cycle
- **[P2]** - Normal priority issues to fix eventually
- **[P3]** - Low priority nice-to-have improvements

### Bug detection criteria

The AI only flags issues as bugs when they meet ALL of these criteria:

1. **Meaningful impact** - Affects accuracy, performance, security, or maintainability
2. **Discrete and actionable** - Clear, specific issue with a clear fix
3. **Appropriate rigor** - Fix doesn't demand more rigor than the rest of the codebase
4. **Introduced in changes** - Bug was added in the reviewed changes (not pre-existing)
5. **Worth fixing** - Author would likely fix if made aware
6. **No unstated assumptions** - Based on verifiable facts, not speculation
7. **Provably affected** - Can identify specific affected code, not theoretical
8. **Not intentional** - Clearly not a deliberate design choice

### Comment style

Review comments follow these principles:

- **Clear reasoning** - Explains why something is an issue
- **Appropriate severity** - Communicates impact accurately
- **Brief** - Maximum 1 paragraph per finding
- **Minimal code** - Code chunks limited to 3 lines in markdown
- **Scenario-specific** - Describes affected environments/conditions
- **Matter-of-fact tone** - Avoids accusatory language
- **Immediately graspable** - Easy for the author to understand
- **No excessive flattery** - Focuses on actionable feedback

### Output format

Each finding includes:

- **Clear title** (≤80 characters, imperative mood)
- **Explanation** of why this is a problem
- **File path and line numbers** where applicable
- **Priority level** [P0-P3]
- **Suggested fix** (when concrete replacement code is available)

Plus an **overall assessment**:
- Whether changes are correct or incorrect
- 1-3 sentence summary

## Tips and best practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="When to use each review type">
    - **Uncommitted changes**: During active development, before staging commits
    - **Base branch review**: Before creating PRs, to catch issues early
    - **Commit review**: After merging, to understand historical changes or review teammate's commits
    - **Custom instructions**: When you need focused analysis (security, performance, specific patterns)
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Making the most of reviews">
    - Run reviews frequently during development, not just before commits
    - Use custom instructions for domain-specific concerns your team cares about
    - Treat P0/P1 findings seriously—they represent real issues worth addressing
    - Review the overall assessment for context on whether changes are sound
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Navigating the review UI">
    - Press **Esc** to go back at any step in the review flow
    - From the preset selection, **Esc** closes the review overlay
    - Use arrow keys to navigate branch/commit lists
    - Type to filter branches by name in real-time
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Integration with workflows">
    The `/review` command is interactive and meant for CLI sessions. For automated reviews in CI/CD, use:
    ```bash
    droid exec "Review the changes in this PR for security issues and performance regressions"
    ```
    See the [Code Review guide](/guides/droid-exec/code-review) for automation examples.
  </Accordion>
