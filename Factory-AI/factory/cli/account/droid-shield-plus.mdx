## What is Droid Shield Plus?

Droid Shield Plus is an advanced AI-powered security layer that provides real-time protection against prompt injection attacks, sensitive data exposure, and other security threats. Unlike the standard [Droid Shield](/cli/account/droid-shield) which uses pattern-based detection, Droid Shield Plus leverages **[Palo Alto Networks Prisma AIRS](https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/ai-runtime-security)** (AI Runtime Security) to provide intelligent, context-aware security scanning.

## How Droid Shield Plus Works

Droid Shield Plus provides two layers of protection:

### 1. Prompt Security Scanning

Every prompt you send to Droid is automatically scanned before processing. If a threat is detected, the prompt is blocked and you're notified:

```
Droid Shield Plus has blocked this prompt due to detected: prompt injection, sensitive data.

If you believe this is a false positive, you can disable Droid Shield Plus in settings.
```

**Detected threat categories:**
- **Prompt Injection** — Attempts to manipulate AI instructions
- **Sensitive Data (DLP)** — PII, credentials, or confidential information
- **Toxic Content** — Harmful or inappropriate content
- **Malicious Code** — Suspicious code patterns

### 2. Git Commit Scanning

When you perform `git commit` or `git push` operations through Droid, Droid Shield Plus scans your staged changes using AI-powered analysis:

```
Droid Shield Plus has detected potential secrets in your staged changes.

If you would like to override, you can either:
1. Perform the commit/push yourself manually
2. Disable Droid Shield Plus in settings
```

This provides significantly more accurate detection than regex-based scanning, catching:
- Obfuscated or encoded secrets
- Context-aware credential detection
- Custom secret formats
- Secrets embedded in complex code structures

## Handling Blocked Prompts

When Droid Shield Plus blocks a prompt or git operation:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Review the detection">
    Carefully examine what was flagged. The error message will indicate the threat category (prompt injection, sensitive data, toxic content, or malicious code).
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Remove sensitive content">
    If sensitive data was detected:
    - Move secrets to environment variables
    - Use secure credential stores
    - Remove PII from prompts
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Rephrase if needed">
    If prompt injection was detected, rephrase your request to avoid patterns that could be misinterpreted as manipulation attempts.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Report false positives">
    If you believe the detection is incorrect, contact [support@factory.ai](mailto:support@factory.ai) with details about the false positive.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Warning>
  **Never disable Droid Shield Plus just to bypass security checks.** If content is being blocked, there's likely a legitimate security concern that should be addressed.
</Warning>
