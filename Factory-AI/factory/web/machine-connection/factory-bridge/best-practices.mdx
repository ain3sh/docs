description: Recommendations and strategies for effectively integrating Factory Bridge into your development workflow
---

Factory Bridge creates powerful opportunities to seamlessly integrate your local environment with Factory. This guide provides best practices to help you maximize the benefits while maintaining security and efficiency.

## Workflow Integration

### Development Environment Setup

<Steps>
  <Step title="Standardize Project Structures">
    Create consistent project structures across your repositories to make it easier to automate common tasks with Factory Bridge.

    ```
    project-root/
    ├── src/
    ├── tests/
    ├── docs/
    ├── scripts/
    └── package.json
    ```

  </Step>

  <Step title="Create Utility Scripts">
    Develop standardized utility scripts for common tasks to simplify command execution through Factory:

    ```bash
    # build.sh
    #!/bin/bash
    echo "Building project..."
    npm run build
    ```

    This allows you to run `./scripts/build.sh` instead of remembering complex build commands.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Set Up Path References">
    Store frequently used paths in your Factory sessions to make command execution more consistent:

    ```
    Project path: /Users/username/projects/my-app
    Build script: ./scripts/build.sh
    Test script: ./scripts/test.sh
    ```

  </Step>
</Steps>

### Task Automation

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Common Development Tasks">
    Create command sequences for regular development tasks:

    ```
    # Start development environment
    cd /path/to/project
    npm install
    npm start
    ```

    Factory can execute these commands in sequence, monitoring output at each stage.

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Testing Workflows">
    Establish consistent testing workflows:

    ```
    # Run tests for a specific feature
    cd /path/to/project
    npm test -- --filter=feature-name
    ```

    Factory can execute tests and help analyze the results in the same session.

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Deployment Preparation">
    Prepare for deployment with confidence:

    ```
    # Prepare for deployment
    cd /path/to/project
    npm run lint
    npm test
    npm run build
    ```

    Factory can execute these commands sequentially, only proceeding if each step succeeds.

  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Performance Optimization

### Resource Management

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Limit Long-Running Processes" icon="gauge-high">
    Remember that each process started through Factory Bridge consumes resources on your local machine. Terminate processes when they're no longer needed to free up resources.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Monitor Resource Usage" icon="chart-line">
    Periodically check system resource usage when running multiple processes through Factory Bridge to ensure optimal performance.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Command Execution Strategies

<Steps>
  <Step title="Choose the Right Working Directory">
    Always specify the most specific working directory for commands to avoid unexpected behavior and improve performance.

    ```
    # Good practice
    cd /path/to/specific/module
    npm test

    # Instead of
    cd /path/to/large/project
    cd module
    npm test
    ```

  </Step>

  <Step title="Batch Similar Commands">
    Group similar commands to reduce overhead:

    ```
    # Good practice
    cd /path/to/project && npm install && npm test

    # Instead of separate commands
    cd /path/to/project
    npm install
    npm test
    ```

  </Step>

  <Step title="Use Background Processes When Appropriate">
    For long-running processes that you don't need to monitor continuously, consider running them in the background:

    ```
    nohup npm start > app.log 2>&1 &
    ```

    This allows you to continue working with Factory while the process runs.

  </Step>
</Steps>

## Security Best Practices

### Access Control

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Manage Pairing Codes Carefully" icon="key">
    Treat your Factory Bridge pairing code like a password. Don't share it with others, and regenerate it if you suspect it's been compromised.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Use Separate Environments" icon="shield-halved">
    Consider setting up different environments (e.g., development, testing, production) with appropriate access controls for each stage of development.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Command Execution Safety

<Steps>
  <Step title="Review Commands Before Execution">
    Always review commands suggested by Factory before allowing them to execute, especially commands that modify your system or access sensitive data.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Avoid Hardcoded Credentials">
    Never include credentials directly in commands. Instead, use environment variables or secure credential storage solutions.

    ```
    # Avoid
    mysql -u root -p"password"

    # Better
    mysql -u root -p
    # Then use Pipe Process Input to enter the password
    ```

  </Step>

  <Step title="Limit Command Scope">
    Restrict commands to the minimum permissions needed for the task:

    ```
    # Instead of
    sudo npm install -g package

    # Use
    npm install --save-dev package
    ```

  </Step>
</Steps>

### Data Protection

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Handling Sensitive Data">
    When working with sensitive data:

    1. Minimize exposure of sensitive data in command outputs
    2. Avoid commands that might display credentials or keys
    3. Be cautious when running diagnostic commands that might reveal system information
    4. Clear sensitive data from logs and terminal outputs

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Secure File Operations">
    When working with files containing sensitive information:

    1. Ensure appropriate file permissions
    2. Be careful with wildcards in commands that could accidentally include sensitive files
    3. Verify target directories before executing file operations
    4. Use temporary directories for processing sensitive data when possible

  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Advanced Integration Techniques

### Chaining Tools Together

Combine Factory Bridge tools for more complex workflows:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Interactive Script Execution">
    Execute a script that requires user input:

    ```
    # Execute a Python script
    python interactive_script.py

    # Use Pipe Process Input to provide responses to prompts
    # For each prompt: send input with appropriate termination
    ```

  </Step>

  <Step title="Process Management Lifecycle">
    Manage the complete lifecycle of a process:

    ```
    # Start a server
    npm start

    # Interact with the server through another process
    curl http://localhost:3000/api/test

    # Terminate the server when testing is complete
    # Use Kill Process tool with the server's PID
    ```

  </Step>
</Steps>

### Custom Automation Scripts

Create custom scripts specifically designed to work well with Factory Bridge:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Progress Reporting">
    Design scripts with clear progress indicators:

    ```bash
    #!/bin/bash
    echo "Step 1: Installing dependencies..."
    npm install
    echo "Step 2: Running tests..."
    npm test
    echo "Step 3: Building application..."
    npm run build
    echo "Complete!"
    ```

    This makes it easier to track progress in Factory.

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Interactive Decision Points">
    Create scripts with clear interactive prompts:

    ```bash
    #!/bin/bash
    echo "Deploy to production? (y/n)"
    read response
    if [ "$response" = "y" ]; then
        echo "Deploying to production..."
        # deployment commands
    else
        echo "Deployment cancelled."
    fi
    ```

    Factory can use the Pipe Process Input tool to respond to these prompts.

  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Troubleshooting Techniques

### Diagnostic Strategies

<Steps>
  <Step title="Isolate Issues">
    When troubleshooting, isolate components to identify the source of problems:

    ```
    # Test database connection
    mysql -u username -p -e "SELECT 1"

    # Test API endpoint
    curl http://localhost:3000/api/health

    # Check process status
    ps aux | grep server
    ```

  </Step>

  <Step title="Capture Detailed Logs">
    Capture comprehensive logs for troubleshooting:

    ```
    # Redirect both stdout and stderr to a log file
    npm start > app.log 2>&1

    # Use verbose mode when available
    npm install --verbose
    ```

  </Step>

  <Step title="Check Environment Variables">
    Verify environment variables affecting your applications:

    ```
    # Print environment variables
    env | grep NODE
    ```

  </Step>
</Steps>

### Common Resolution Patterns

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Connection Issues">
    If Factory cannot connect to Bridge:

    1. Check Factory Bridge is running (look for the tray icon)
    2. Verify the pairing code is correct
    3. Restart Factory Bridge
    4. Check for network issues or firewalls blocking connections
    5. Try reconnecting from a new Factory session
    6. Verify you haven't exceeded the maximum number of connected sessions

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Command Execution Failures">
    When commands fail to execute properly:

    1. Try running the same command directly in your terminal
    2. Check for environment differences between Factory Bridge and your terminal
    3. Verify paths and working directories
    4. Check for permission issues
    5. Look for locked files or resources
