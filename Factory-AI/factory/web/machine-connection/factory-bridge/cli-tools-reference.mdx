## Running Commands

Execute any command you would normally run in your terminal directly from Factory.

### How It Works

1. Connect Factory Bridge to your local machine
2. Ask Factory to run a command
3. View the results directly in your conversation

### Examples

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="List Files">
    **Request**:
    ```
    Run 'ls -la' in my home directory
    ```

    Factory will execute this command and show you the output:
    ```
    total 112
    drwxr-xr-x   18 user  staff    576 Mar 12 15:46 .
    drwxr-xr-x    5 root  admin    160 Feb  1 09:34 ..
    drwxr-xr-x   14 user  staff    448 Mar 12 14:22 .git
    -rw-r--r--    1 user  staff    310 Mar  9 10:13 .gitignore
    -rw-r--r--    1 user  staff   1064 Mar  9 10:13 README.md
    drwxr-xr-x    8 user  staff    256 Mar 12 14:22 src
    ```

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Building Projects">
    **Request**:
    ```
    Build my React app using 'npm run build' in my project directory
    ```

    Factory will execute the build command and display the progress in real-time.

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Starting Development Servers">
    **Request**:
    ```
    Start a development server with 'npm start' in my project
    ```

    Factory will start the server and stream the output, allowing you to monitor the process.

  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Managing Processes

Easily control processes that you've started through Factory.

### How It Works

1. Start a process using Factory
2. If needed, ask Factory to terminate the process
3. Factory will safely shut down the process for you

## Interactive Applications

Interact with command-line applications that require user input.

### How It Works

1. Start an interactive process through Factory
2. Send input as needed, including confirmation responses, text entries, and commands
3. Factory will relay your input to the application and display the results

- Consider security implications before running sensitive commands
- Always verify process information before termination

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Command Not Found">
    - Verify the command is installed on your system
    - Check if the command is in your system PATH
    - Try using the full path to the executable
    - Ensure you're using the correct environment for specialized commands
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Permission Issues">
    - Check file and directory permissions
    - Ensure you have appropriate access rights
    - For scripts, verify they have execution permissions
    - Use elevated privileges only when necessary and with caution
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Process Communication">
    - Verify processes are still running before attempting interaction
    - Check output logs for error messages
    - Restart processes if connection is lost
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Security Considerations

When using CLI tools through Factory Bridge, keep these security considerations in mind:

- All commands execute with your user permissions on your local machine
- Avoid running commands that could expose sensitive information
- Be cautious with commands that make system changes
- Consider using dedicated environments for sensitive operations
