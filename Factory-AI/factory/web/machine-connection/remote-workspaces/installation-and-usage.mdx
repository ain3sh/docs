title: Remote Workspaces – Installation & Usage
description: Set up, connect to, and use Remote Workspaces inside Factory sessions
---

A **remote workspace** is a fully-configured, on-demand development environment that lives in the cloud. Remote workspaces give you the same tools and dependencies you'd expect locally, so you can build, test, and run code directly from Factory.

<Note>
  To get the most out of remote workspaces, configure environment variables and a setup script during workspace creation. The setup script installs dependencies and prepares your development environment automatically, ensuring every team member has an identical setup.
</Note>

## System Requirements

- A repository enabled in Factory
- Manager role or higher to create remote workspaces

<Steps>

  <Step title="Open Session Settings">
    1. In Factory, click the **Settings** icon from the left sidebar.  
    2. Select **Session**.
    3. Scroll down to **Remote Workspaces**.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create a New Remote Workspace">
    1. Click **Create Workspace**.  
    2. Enter the repository you want to use.  
    3. Give your workspace a friendly name (e.g., “frontend-workspace”).  
    4. (Optional) Configure a setup script to run during workspace initialization.
    5. Click **Create**.
    <Note>
      Factory clones your repo and prepares the environment—this can take a minute for large projects.
    </Note>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Verify Workspace Ready">
    The new workspace appears in the list with a status indicator. Once it shows **Ready**, you can use it from any session.
  </Step>

</Steps>
