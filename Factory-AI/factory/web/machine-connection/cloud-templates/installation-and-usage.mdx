title: Cloud Templates – Installation & Usage
description: Set up, connect to, and use Cloud Templates inside Factory sessions
---

A **cloud template** is a fully-configured, on-demand development environment that lives in the cloud. Cloud templates give you the same tools and dependencies you'd expect locally, so you can build, test, and run code directly from Factory.

<Note>
  To get the most out of cloud templates, configure environment variables and a setup script during template creation. The setup script installs dependencies and prepares your development environment automatically, ensuring every team member has an identical setup.
</Note>

## System Requirements

- A repository enabled in Factory
- Manager role or higher to create cloud templates

<Steps>

  <Step title="Open Cloud Templates Settings">
    1. In Factory, click the **Settings** icon from the left sidebar.  
    2. Select **Cloud Templates**.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create a New Cloud Template">
    1. Click **Create Template**.  
    2. Enter the repository you want to use.  
    3. Give your template a friendly name (e.g., “frontend-template”).  
    4. (Optional) Configure a setup script to run during template initialization.
    5. Click **Create**.
    <Note>
      Factory clones your repo and prepares the environment—this can take a minute for large projects.
    </Note>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Verify Template Ready">
    The new template appears in the list with a status indicator. Once it shows **Ready**, you can use it from any session.
  </Step>
