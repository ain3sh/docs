The Autonomy Maturity dashboard provides a centralized view of your organization's maturity scores across all repositories, with historical trends and detailed breakdowns.

## Accessing the Dashboard

Navigate to **Settings → Analytics → Autonomy Maturity** in the Factory app.

---

## Main Dashboard View

The dashboard shows an organization-level overview with three main sections:

### Summary Cards

At the top, you'll see key metrics:

| Metric                   | Description                                                                 |
| :----------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Organization Score**   | Average maturity level across all measured repositories (rounded down)      |
| **Repositories Tracked** | Number of repositories with maturity reports vs. total enabled repositories |
| **Last Updated**         | Time since the most recent maturity evaluation                              |

### Progress Graph

A time-series chart showing your organization's maturity level over time. Use the period filters to view different time ranges:

- **7d** — Last 7 days
- **1m** — Last month
- **6m** — Last 6 months
- **1y** — Last year
- **all** — All time

### Repositories Table

A searchable, paginated table of all repositories showing:

- **Repository name** — Click to view details
- **Level** — Current maturity level (1-5)
- **Progress** — Percentage complete toward next level
- **Last Update** — When the repository was last evaluated

Use the search bar to filter repositories by name or URL.

## Repository Detail Page

Click any repository row to view its detailed maturity breakdown.

![Repository Detail Page](/images/web/maturity-criteria.png)

### Header

Shows the repository name, current level achieved, last evaluation time, and a **Refresh** button to trigger a new evaluation.

### Level Accordions

Each maturity level (Functional through Autonomous) has an expandable accordion section showing:

- **Percentage complete** — How much of that level's criteria are passing
- **Lock status** — Levels are locked until the previous level reaches 80%

### Criterion Rows

Within each level, individual criteria display:

| Element       | Description                                        |
| :------------ | :------------------------------------------------- |
| **Name**      | The criterion being evaluated                      |
| **Score**     | Format `[X/Y]` — numerator/denominator             |
| **Status**    | Pass (green) or fail (red) indicator               |
| **Rationale** | Click to expand and see the evaluation explanation |

### Remediation (Coming Soon)

Soon, failing criteria will display a **Fix** button that triggers automated remediation. Select the criteria you want to fix, and the system will implement the necessary changes to your repository.

## Triggering a Refresh

There are two ways to refresh a maturity evaluation:

### From the Web Dashboard

1. Navigate to the repository detail page
2. Click the **Refresh** button in the header
3. A new session starts on a remote workspace for the repo
4. Once done, the dashboard will update with results from the latest report

### From the CLI

Run the `/readiness-report` [slash command](/cli/features/readiness-report) in the Factory CLI while in the repository directory:

```bash
droid
> /readiness-report
```

<Note>
  Re-evaluations run the full maturity assessment against the current state of
  your repository. This is useful after making infrastructure improvements or
  merging changes that can affect a maturity criterion.
</Note>

## Understanding the Metrics

### Organization Level Calculation

The organization-level score is calculated as the **average of all repository levels, rounded down**. For example:

- Repo A: Level 3
- Repo B: Level 2
- Repo C: Level 3

Organization Level = floor((3 + 2 + 3) / 3) = floor(2.67) = **Level 2**

### Repository Level Calculation

A repository's level is determined by the **80% threshold system**:

1. Start at Level 1
2. If 80% of Level 1 criteria pass → achieve Level 2
3. If 80% of Level 2 criteria pass → achieve Level 3
4. Continue through Level 5

The percentage shown for each level indicates progress toward completing that level's criteria.

## Best Practices

- **Regular evaluations:** Run maturity reports after significant infrastructure changes
- **Focus on current level:** Address failing criteria in your current level before jumping ahead to focus on foundational improvements first
- **Track trends:** Use the progress graph to monitor improvement over time
- **Prioritize high-impact fixes:** The action items in CLI reports highlight the most impactful improvements
