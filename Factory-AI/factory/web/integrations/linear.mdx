## Verification

To ensure the integration is working correctly:

3. Verify that the changes are reflected in Linear.

## Best Practices

- Regularly review and audit the permissions granted to Factory.
- Use Linear's team-level settings to manage access efficiently.
- Keep your Linear workspace's security settings up-to-date.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues during integration:

- Ensure you have the necessary admin rights on both Factory and Linear.
- Check Linear's audit logs for any permission-related issues.
- Verify that the integration has access to the intended teams and projects.

For persistent problems, contact Factory support with specific error messages or screenshots.
