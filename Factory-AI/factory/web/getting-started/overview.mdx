- **Local machine connection**: Work directly on your local filesystem with full access to your development environment, tools, and workflows.
- **Deep codebase understanding**: Droid leverages your project context, documentation, and team knowledge to provide contextually aware assistance.
- **Engineering system integration**: Connect to Jira, Notion, Slack, Linear, PagerDuty, and more — so development work stays synchronized with your team.

## Why teams choose Factory

- **Built for enterprise**: SOC-2 compliance, on-premise deployment options, and security-first design.
