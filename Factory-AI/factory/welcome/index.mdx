## Why us?

* **Model-agnostic:** use OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, X AI, open-source or local models.
* **Context-confidence:** compresses incrementally with anchor points for near-perfect context.
* **Specification mode:** detailed implementation, technical details and mixed model support.
* **Enterprise-ready:** SSO + SAML, dedicated compute, compliance & security and more.
