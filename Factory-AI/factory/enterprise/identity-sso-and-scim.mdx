title: SSO, IdP & SCIM Provisioning
description: How to integrate Factory with your Identity Provider using SAML/OIDC SSO and SCIM to manage access to Droids at scale.
---

This page describes how to connect Factory to your **Identity Provider (IdP)** and keep access to Droids synchronized using **SSO and SCIM**.

It is IdP‑agnostic and applies to Okta, Azure AD, Google Workspace, and other enterprise identity platforms.

---

## Overview

Factory supports two main identity integrations:

- **SAML 2.0 / OIDC SSO** – developers sign in with corporate credentials; no separate Factory password.
- **SCIM 2.0 provisioning** – users and groups are created, updated, and removed automatically from your IdP.

Together, these give you:

- Centralized control over who can access Factory and Droids.
- Automatic deprovisioning when people leave or change roles.
- Consistent role and group mappings across web, CLI, and automation.

The high‑level flow is:

1. Configure an SSO application for Factory in your IdP.
2. Map IdP attributes (email, name, groups) into Factory.
3. Enable SCIM for automatic user and group provisioning (optional but recommended).
4. Map directory groups to Factory orgs, teams, and roles.

---

## Prerequisites

Before setting up SSO and SCIM:

- You are on a plan that includes **enterprise SSO support**.
- You have **admin access** to your IdP (or a partner in IT who does).
- You have a **Factory admin** who can coordinate configuration on the Factory side.

We generally recommend treating SSO + SCIM as a joint effort between your **security/IT** and **platform/dev‑prod** teams.

## SSO configuration (IdP‑agnostic)

Factory supports both **SAML 2.0** and **OIDC**. The exact UI varies by IdP, but the concepts are the same.

### 1. Create a Factory application in your IdP

In your IdP admin console:

1. Create a new application for **Factory**.
2. Choose **SAML** or **OIDC** as the protocol (Factory supports both; your account team can recommend one based on your environment).
3. Assign the application to a small test group of users first (for example, `factory-pilot-users`).

Your Factory contact will provide or confirm:

- The **redirect / callback URL** for SSO.
- The **entity ID / client ID** and any other required metadata.

### 2. Configure SAML/OIDC metadata

In the IdP application you just created:

- For **SAML**:
  - Set the **Assertion Consumer Service (ACS) URL** / Single Sign‑On URL to the value provided by Factory.
  - Set the **Entity ID** / Audience URI as provided by Factory.
  - Configure the NameID format and attributes as recommended (typically email address as the primary identifier).

- For **OIDC**:
  - Use the Factory‑provided **client ID** and **redirect URI**.
  - Configure the **scopes** to include at least `openid`, `profile`, and `email`.

Factory will consume the IdP metadata (SAML XML or OIDC discovery configuration) and establish the trust relationship.

### 3. Map attributes and groups

Next, configure which attributes your IdP sends to Factory in the SAML assertion or OIDC ID token.

We recommend at least:

- **Email** – primary unique identifier (for example, `user.userprincipalname`, `user.mail`).
- **Display name** – used in UI (for example, `user.displayname`).
- **Groups or roles** – used to map users into Factory orgs and roles.

Common patterns include groups such as:

- `factory-org-owners`
- `factory-org-admins`
- `factory-users`
- `factory-ci-bots`

These groups can be mapped on the Factory side to **Owner**, **Admin**, and **Member** roles, and to specific orgs or teams.

### 4. Test the connection

Once metadata and attributes are configured:

1. Use a test user in your IdP who is assigned to the Factory application.
2. Initiate login from the Factory sign‑in page using “Sign in with SSO” / your IdP button.
3. Verify that:
   - The user is redirected to the IdP, authenticates, and returns to Factory.
   - The user lands in the correct org/team with the expected role.

If anything fails, check the IdP’s logs and Factory’s error message; most issues are due to mismatched URLs, certificates, or attribute mappings.

---

## SCIM provisioning

SSO controls **how users authenticate**; SCIM controls **which users and groups exist** in Factory.

With SCIM enabled:

- New employees in relevant IdP groups get access to Factory automatically.
- Users removed from those groups lose access automatically.
- Group membership changes propagate into Factory without manual updates.

### 1. Enable SCIM in Factory

Your Factory admin (or account team) will:

- Enable SCIM for your organization.
- Provide a **SCIM base URL** and **SCIM bearer token** for your IdP.

Treat the SCIM token as a secret; store it only in your IdP’s application configuration.

### 2. Configure SCIM in your IdP

In your IdP’s SCIM settings for the Factory application:

1. Enable **automatic provisioning**.
2. Paste the **SCIM base URL** and **SCIM token** from Factory.
3. Choose which users and groups to sync (for example, only `factory-*` groups).
4. Configure attribute mappings if required (for example, `userName` → email, `displayName` → name).

Once enabled, your IdP will start pushing users and groups to Factory and keep them synchronized.

### 3. Map directory groups to Factory roles

With SCIM in place, group management should happen **only in your IdP**.

Use group naming and mapping rules such as:

- `factory-org-owners` → Factory org Owners.
- `factory-org-admins` → Factory org Admins.
- `factory-users` → Factory Members.
- `factory-ci-bots` → machine/service accounts with restricted permissions.

This keeps RBAC definitions in one place (your IdP) and lets you audit them alongside other enterprise apps.

---

## Service accounts and CI access

Most organizations also need **non‑human identities** for CI/CD and automation.

Recommended pattern:

- Create **dedicated CI groups** (for example, `factory-ci-bots`).
- Provision CI accounts via SCIM into Factory using those groups.
- Issue tokens for CI workflows scoped to the relevant orgs/teams.

This keeps human and machine access clearly separated while still benefiting from centralized provisioning and deprovisioning.

---

## Troubleshooting & best practices

Common issues and recommendations:

- **Login loops or failures**
  - Verify ACS / redirect URLs exactly match what Factory provided.
  - Confirm certificates or signing keys have not expired or been rotated without updating Factory.

- **User lands in wrong org or role**
  - Check group memberships and mapping rules.
  - Ensure the intended groups are included in SAML assertions or ID tokens.

- **Provisioning not working**
  - Confirm SCIM is enabled in both Factory and your IdP.
  - Check SCIM logs in your IdP for errors (invalid token, URL, or schema).

Best practices:

- Keep a **small pilot group** for initial rollout and future changes.
- Use **clear, prefix‑based group names** (for example, `factory-*`) to keep IdP configuration maintainable.
- Manage all role changes and access reviews in your IdP to leverage existing governance processes.

Once SSO and SCIM are in place, the **Identity & Access Management** overview explains how these identities are enforced at runtime for Droids.
