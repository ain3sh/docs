title: Enterprise Plugin Registry
description: Centralize and distribute approved plugins across your organization with a private plugin marketplace.
---

An **Enterprise Plugin Registry** is a centralized, private repository where organizations maintain approved plugins for company-wide distribution. Instead of individual teams discovering and vetting plugins independently, the registry provides a curated catalog of capabilities that are pre-approved, maintained, and ready to use.

## Why use an Enterprise Plugin Registry?

| Challenge | Solution |
|-----------|----------|
| **Inconsistent tooling** across teams | Single source of approved plugins ensures everyone uses the same capabilities |
| **Security and compliance review** for each plugin | Vet plugins once at the org level, distribute everywhere |
| **Onboarding new developers** | New team members instantly access all approved capabilities |
| **Role-specific tooling** | Package plugins by team function (security, frontend, data, etc.) |
| **Version control** | Manage plugin versions centrally, roll out updates organization-wide |

## Setting up a registry

An Enterprise Plugin Registry is a Git repository containing your organization's approved plugins with a marketplace manifest.

### Repository structure

```
your-org/droid-plugins/
├── .factory-plugin/
│   └── marketplace.json      # Registry manifest
├── plugins/
│   ├── security-toolkit/     # Security team plugins
│   │   ├── .factory-plugin/
│   │   │   └── plugin.json
│   │   └── skills/
│   ├── frontend-standards/   # Frontend team plugins
│   │   ├── .factory-plugin/
│   │   │   └── plugin.json
│   │   └── skills/
│   ├── data-engineering/     # Data team plugins
│   │   └── ...
│   └── platform-tools/       # Platform/DevOps plugins
│       └── ...
└── README.md
```

### Marketplace manifest

Create `.factory-plugin/marketplace.json` to register your plugins:

```json
{
  "name": "acme-corp-plugins",
  "description": "ACME Corp approved Droid plugins",
  "owner": {
    "name": "ACME Platform Team",
    "email": "platform@acme.com"
  },
  "plugins": [
    {
      "name": "security-toolkit",
      "description": "Security review, threat modeling, and vulnerability scanning",
      "source": "./plugins/security-toolkit",
      "category": "security"
    },
    {
      "name": "frontend-standards",
      "description": "React component patterns, accessibility checks, design system integration",
      "source": "./plugins/frontend-standards",
      "category": "frontend"
    },
    {
      "name": "data-engineering",
      "description": "SQL review, pipeline validation, data quality checks",
      "source": "./plugins/data-engineering",
      "category": "data"
    },
    {
      "name": "platform-tools",
      "description": "CI/CD helpers, infrastructure review, deployment automation",
      "source": "./plugins/platform-tools",
      "category": "platform"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Org-level configuration

Configure the registry at the organization level so it's automatically available to all users. Add to your org-managed settings:

```json
{
  "extraKnownMarketplaces": {
    "acme-corp-plugins": {
      "source": {
        "source": "github",
        "repo": "your-org/droid-plugins"
      }
    }
  },
  "enabledPlugins": {
    "security-toolkit@acme-corp-plugins": true,
    "platform-tools@acme-corp-plugins": true
  }
}
```

| Field | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `extraKnownMarketplaces` | Registers the marketplace so users can browse and install plugins |
| `enabledPlugins` | Pre-installs specific plugins for all users (optional) |

### Restricting marketplaces

To prevent users from adding unapproved marketplaces, use `strictKnownMarketplaces`:

```json
{
  "strictKnownMarketplaces": [
    { "source": "github", "repo": "your-org/droid-plugins" },
    { "source": "github", "repo": "Factory-AI/factory-plugins" }
  ]
}
```

When `strictKnownMarketplaces` is set:
- Users can only add marketplaces from the approved list
- Plugin installations from non-approved marketplaces are blocked
- Existing unapproved marketplaces continue to work but cannot be updated

With this configuration:
- The registry appears automatically when users run `/plugins`
- Pre-enabled plugins are available immediately without manual installation
- Users can install additional plugins from the registry as needed

## User experience

Users manage plugins via the `/plugins` UI:

1. Run `/plugins` to open the plugin manager
2. Browse tab shows plugins from all registered marketplaces including the org registry
3. Org-enabled plugins are pre-installed automatically on startup

For CLI access:

```bash
droid plugin install frontend-standards@acme-corp-plugins
droid plugin update security-toolkit@acme-corp-plugins
```

Users see the registry alongside public marketplaces, with org plugins clearly labeled.

## Organizing plugins by role

Structure your registry to match your organization's teams and workflows:

### By team function

```
plugins/
├── security/           # AppSec team
├── frontend/           # Web/mobile teams  
├── backend/            # API/services teams
├── data/               # Data engineering/science
├── platform/           # DevOps/SRE
└── compliance/         # Legal/compliance
```

### By capability

```
plugins/
├── code-review/        # Review and quality
├── testing/            # Test generation and validation
├── documentation/      # Doc generation and maintenance
├── migrations/         # Code and data migrations
└── security/           # Security scanning and review
```

### By project type

```
plugins/
├── microservices/      # Service development patterns
├── monolith/           # Legacy system tools
├── data-pipelines/     # ETL and batch processing
└── ml-projects/        # ML/AI development
```

## Pre-installing plugins

For critical capabilities that everyone needs, use `enabledPlugins` in org-managed settings:

```json
{
  "enabledPlugins": {
    "security-toolkit@acme-corp-plugins": true,
    "code-standards@acme-corp-plugins": true
  }
}
```

Pre-installed plugins:
- Are available immediately on first Droid session
- Are installed with `org` scope automatically
- Can be updated via `/plugins` UI or `droid plugin update`

## Version management

Plugins are versioned by Git commit hash. When a plugin is updated, Droid fetches the latest commit from the marketplace.

To control versions, use Git branches:
- `main` - Production-ready for all users
- `staging` - For early adopters
- `dev` - For internal testing

<Note>
Version pinning via the `version` field is not currently supported. The field is for documentation only.
</Note>

## Private repository access

For private Git repositories, ensure Droid can authenticate:

### GitHub Enterprise

```bash
# Users authenticate via gh CLI
gh auth login --hostname github.your-company.com
```

### GitLab Self-Hosted

```bash
# Configure git credentials
git config --global credential.helper store
```

### SSH-based access

Ensure SSH keys are configured for the repository host.

## Local marketplaces

For air-gapped environments or when Git access is restricted, you can use local directory marketplaces. This is useful for:
- Environments without internet access
- Testing plugins before publishing
- Internal distribution via shared network drives

### Setting up a local marketplace

Create a directory with the standard marketplace structure:

```
/shared/company-plugins/
├── .factory-plugin/
│   └── marketplace.json
└── plugins/
    ├── security-toolkit/
    │   └── .factory-plugin/
    │       └── plugin.json
    └── code-standards/
        └── .factory-plugin/
            └── plugin.json
```

### Adding a local marketplace

Via UI: `/plugins` → Marketplaces tab → "Add new marketplace" → enter absolute path

Via CLI:

```bash
droid plugin marketplace add /shared/company-plugins
```

### Configuration for auto-registration

Use the `local` source type in settings:

```json
{
  "extraKnownMarketplaces": {
    "company-local-plugins": {
      "source": {
        "source": "local",
        "path": "/shared/company-plugins"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

<Note>
When removing a local marketplace from the registry, Droid does **not** delete the source directory. Only Git-cloned marketplaces have their directories removed on deletion.
</Note>

## Best practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Establish a review process">
    Before adding plugins to the registry:
    - Security review for any external dependencies
    - Code review by platform team
    - Testing in isolated environment
    - Documentation requirements
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Document each plugin">
    Every plugin should have a README covering:
    - What capabilities it provides
    - When to use it (and when not to)
    - Any prerequisites or dependencies
    - Example usage
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Version semantically">
    Use semantic versioning so teams know what to expect:
    - **Major**: Breaking changes to commands or behavior
    - **Minor**: New capabilities, backward compatible
    - **Patch**: Bug fixes only
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Monitor adoption">
    Track which plugins are being used:
    - Installation counts
    - Active usage metrics
    - Feedback from teams
    - Issues and feature requests
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Plan for deprecation">
    When retiring plugins:
    - Announce deprecation timeline
    - Provide migration path to alternatives
    - Keep deprecated plugins available (read-only) during transition
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Example: Financial services org

A financial services company sets up their registry:

**Mandatory plugins** (pre-installed for everyone):
- `compliance-checks` - PCI-DSS and SOX compliance validation
- `security-scanner` - OWASP vulnerability detection
- `audit-logging` - Enhanced audit trail for all Droid actions

**Team-specific plugins** (available for install):
- `trading-systems` - For quantitative and trading teams
- `risk-models` - For risk management teams
- `regulatory-reporting` - For compliance teams

**Configuration (org-managed-settings.json):**

```json
{
  "extraKnownMarketplaces": {
    "acme-financial-plugins": {
      "source": {
        "source": "github",
        "repo": "acme-financial/droid-plugins"
      }
    }
  },
  "enabledPlugins": {
    "compliance-checks@acme-financial-plugins": true,
    "security-scanner@acme-financial-plugins": true,
    "audit-logging@acme-financial-plugins": true
  }
}
```

This ensures every developer has compliance and security tooling from day one, while specialized teams can add domain-specific capabilities.
