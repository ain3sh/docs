This guide will walk you through the process of integrating Factory with Slack, enabling seamless interaction between Factory and your Slack conversations.

## Prerequisites 

- A Factory account with admin privileges
- Admin access to your Slack workspace
- Ability to install apps in your Slack workspace

## Integration Steps

<Steps>
  <Step title="Access Factory Integrations">
    Log in to your Factory account and navigate to the Integrations section in your Settings.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Initiate Slack Integration">
    Click on "Connect" next to Slack to start the integration process.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Authorize Factory's Slack Application">
    You'll be redirected to Slack. Review the requested permissions and click "Allow" to authorize Factory access to your Slack workspace.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select Workspace">
    If you belong to multiple workspaces, select the workspace you want to connect to Factory.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Confirm Integration">
    After authorization, you'll be redirected back to Factory. Verify that the integration status shows as "Connected".
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add to Channels">
    In your Slack workspace, add the Factory app to relevant channels by typing `/invite @Factory` in each channel.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Verification

To ensure the integration is working correctly:

1. Mention `@Factory` in a thread within a channel where the app has been added.
2. Verify that Factory responds with a link to open the conversation in Factory.
3. Click the link and confirm that the Slack thread content appears in your new Factory session.


## Slack Tools

<Warning>
Before using the tools below, make sure that the Factory app is invited
to the channels you'd like to interact with by sending <code>/invite&nbsp;@Factory</code> in those channels.
</Warning>

Factory provides four native tools to interact with Slack:

| Tool | What it does |
| ---- | ------------ |
| **Get Slack Channels** | Lists all channels the bot can access |
| **Post Slack Message** | Sends a message to a channel or replies to an existing thread |
| **Read Thread Messages** | Reads the messages from a Slack thread |
| **Get Channel History** | Retrieves recent messages from a channel |

## Additional Features

Besides the tools above, the Slack integration also allows you to: 

- Mention `@Factory` in any Slack thread to receive a link to continue the conversation in Factory
- Import Slack thread context into Factory by clicking the provided link
- Reference Slack threads in Factory by pasting a thread URL into a Factory chat

When a Slack thread is imported, Factory has access to the entire conversation history, allowing it to provide context-aware assistance.

## Best Practices

- Add the Factory app only to channels where development discussions occur.
- Use threads rather than channel messages when mentioning Factory.
- Provide sufficient context in the Slack thread before mentioning Factory.
- Regularly review the permissions granted to the Factory app in your Slack settings.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues during integration:

- Ensure you have admin rights in both Factory and your Slack workspace.
- Verify that the Factory app has been added to the channel where you're mentioning it.
- If you see a "not_in_channel" error toast when trying to paste a Slack thread URL, it means the Factory bot needs to be invited to that channel. Use `/invite @Factory` in the channel to resolve this issue.
- Check that your organization's firewall isn't blocking webhook communications.
- For persistent issues, contact Factory support with specific error messages.
