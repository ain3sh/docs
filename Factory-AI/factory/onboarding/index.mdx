Welcome to Factory! This onboarding guide will walk you through the process of setting up and configuring your Factory environment, integrating it with your existing engineering systems.

## Onboarding Process Overview

Our onboarding process is divided into four main sections:

1. [Creating Your Factory](/onboarding/creating-your-factory/sso-setup)
2. [Configuring Your Factory](/onboarding/configuring-your-factory/droid-yaml-configuration)
3. [Integrating With Your Engineering System](/onboarding/integrating-with-your-engineering-system/github-cloud)

Each section is designed to guide you through a specific aspect of the setup process, ensuring a smooth and comprehensive onboarding experience.
