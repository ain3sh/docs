<Update label="November 14" rss={{ title: "CLI Updates", description: "Skills system, session favorites, and improved git integration" }}>
  `v0.26.0`

  ## New features

  * **Session Favorites** - New `/favorite` command to pin/unpin sessions, keeping your active projects at the top of the session list
  * **Enhanced Bug Reporting** - The `/bug` command now zips session context, uploads it to Factory, and returns a shareable report ID automatically
  * **Cleaner Diff Viewer** - Improved UI with horizontal lines instead of borders

  ## Bug fixes

  * Always prompt to accept or reject generated specs and pass the correct labels to the UI flow
  * `droid spec` now writes files to the expected default path without manual overrides

</Update>

<Update label="November 13" rss={{ title: "CLI Updates", description: "Execute tool streaming, enhanced hooks system, and MCP autonomy controls" }}>
  `v0.25.0`

  ## New features

  * **Enhanced Hooks System** - Added 7 new hook types for complete lifecycle control:
    * UserPromptSubmit - Modify or validate prompts before they're sent to the agent
