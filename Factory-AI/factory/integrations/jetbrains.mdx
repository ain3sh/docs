## Prerequisites

Before wiring JetBrains to Factory Droid, make sure you have:

1. **Factory account and API key**
   - Sign up at https://app.factory.ai.
   - Add a payment method if prompted.
   - Create an API key at https://app.factory.ai/settings/api-keys.
2. **Factory CLI installed (supported on all operating systems except Windows ARM machines)**

   - Install via:

     ```bash
     curl -fsSL https://app.factory.ai/cli | sh
     ```

   - Set the `FACTORY_API_KEY` environment variable in your shell (for example, add `export FACTORY_API_KEY=your_key_here` to your shell profile).
   - Ensure the `droid` binary is on your PATH (or note its full path).

3. **JetBrains IDE with AI Assistant**
   - Any modern JetBrains IDE that supports AI Assistant / AI Chat and custom agent servers.

<Note>
  You cannot sign up for Factory or manage billing entirely inside JetBrains.
  Account creation and API key management always happen in the web app.
</Note>

## Configure Factory Droid as an AI Agent

Add a **Factory Droid** entry to your JetBrains AI agent server configuration so the AI Assistant can launch the CLI in ACP mode.

```json
{
  "agent_servers": {
    "Factory Droid": {
      "command": "*path/to/droid/cli*",
      "args": ["exec", "--output-format", "acp"],
      "env": {
        "FACTORY_API_KEY": "*get this from inside our web portal*"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

- `command` – full path to the `droid` binary
- `args` – run Droid in exec mode and speak ACP back to JetBrains
- `FACTORY_API_KEY` – API key from https://app.factory.ai/settings/api-keys

## Start a Droid Session in JetBrains

Once the agent server is configured, you interact with Droid entirely through the AI Assistant UI.

### Open the AI Chat Panel

- **Search Everywhere:** Press `Shift`+`Shift`, type **"AI Assistant"**, and open the tool window.
- **Menu:** Go to **View → Tool Windows → AI Assistant** (exact name may vary slightly by IDE).

### Start a New Chat with Factory Droid

1. In the **AI Chat** panel, click **+ New Chat**.
2. In the bottom-left agent dropdown, choose **Factory Droid**.
3. Start chatting as you would in the CLI.

The session uses your last-selected settings for Factory Droid (model, autonomy level, etc.).

## Resume Existing Sessions

JetBrains manages sessions through the AI Chat UI rather than CLI commands.

- In the AI Chat panel, click the **clock icon** in the top-right corner.
- Choose a past conversation to reopen it.

## Models and Autonomy Controls

You can change models and autonomy levels directly from the AI Chat footer.

### Switch Models

- Use the **model dropdown** at the bottom of the AI Chat panel.
- Pick any Factory-supported model (for example, Claude Opus/Sonnet, GPT-5.1 variants, or others configured via BYOK).

  style={{ width: '50%', height: 'auto' }}
/>

### Change Autonomy Level

- Use the **autonomy dropdown** next to the model selector.
- Choose the autonomy level that matches your risk tolerance and workflow.

Recommended pattern:

- Start with a **planning-first** flow (low autonomy, spec-style prompts) for medium and large tasks.
- Once you are happy with the plan, increase autonomy to **Auto low** or **Auto medium** so Droid can execute more steps without constant confirmation.

## Editor Context and Limitations

The current JetBrains integration speaks ACP but does not yet expose full editor context to Droid.

- No automatic sharing of open files, selections, or diagnostics
- No IDE-native diff viewer wired directly to Droid patches

Treat this like a rich chat front-end to the CLI:

- Use clear prompts, reference files by path, and rely on autonomy modes and spec-style planning to manage larger changes.

## Troubleshooting

If Factory Droid does not appear or respond in AI Chat:

- Verify the **CLI**:
  - Run `droid exec --output-format acp` in a regular terminal to confirm the binary and API key work.
- Double-check the **agent server configuration**:
  - Correct path to `droid`
  - `args` includes both `exec` and `--output-format acp`
  - `FACTORY_API_KEY` is present and valid
- Confirm you are not on **Windows on ARM**, which is not yet supported.

For MCP-related issues, check that each MCP server’s command, arguments, and environment variables are valid when run outside JetBrains.
