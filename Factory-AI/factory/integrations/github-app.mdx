## Overview

The `/install-github-app` command provides a guided workflow for installing the Factory GitHub App and configuring GitHub Actions workflows. This enables Droid to respond to @droid mentions in issues and PR comments, and optionally provide automated code reviews on new pull requests.

When you run `/install-github-app`, droid guides you through verifying prerequisites, selecting a repository, installing the GitHub App, and creating workflow files via a pull request.

## Quick start

<Steps>
  <Step title="Start the installation flow">
    In an interactive droid session, type:
    ```bash
    /install-github-app
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Pass preflight checks">
    Droid verifies that you have:
    - GitHub CLI (`gh`) installed
    - Authenticated with GitHub (`gh auth login`)
    - Required OAuth scopes (`repo`, `read:org`)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Select a repository">
    Choose from two options:
    - **Use current repository** - Auto-detected from your git remote
    - **Enter a different repository** - Type `owner/repo` or a GitHub URL
  </Step>

  <Step title="Install the GitHub App">
    Your browser opens to install the Factory Droid GitHub App. Grant access to the selected repository.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Select workflows">
    Choose which workflows to enable:
    - **@Droid** - Respond to @droid mentions in issues and PR comments
    - **Droid Review** - Automated code review on new PRs
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create the PR">
    Droid creates a branch with workflow files and opens a pull request for you to review and merge.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Prerequisites

Before running `/install-github-app`, ensure you have the GitHub CLI installed and authenticated.

### Install GitHub CLI

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="macOS (Homebrew)">
    ```bash
    brew install gh
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="macOS (MacPorts)">
    ```bash
    sudo port install gh
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Linux/WSL">
    ```bash
    type -p curl >/dev/null || (sudo apt update && sudo apt install curl -y)
    curl -fsSL https://cli.github.com/packages/githubcli-archive-keyring.gpg | sudo dd of=/usr/share/keyrings/githubcli-archive-keyring.gpg
    sudo chmod go+r /usr/share/keyrings/githubcli-archive-keyring.gpg
    echo "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/githubcli-archive-keyring.gpg] https://cli.github.com/packages stable main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/github-cli.list > /dev/null
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install gh -y
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Windows">
    ```bash
    winget install --id GitHub.cli
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Authenticate with GitHub

```bash
gh auth login
```

### Verify required scopes

The CLI needs `repo` and `read:org` scopes. If missing, refresh your authentication:

```bash
gh auth refresh -s repo,read:org
```

## Available workflows

### @Droid workflow

Enables Droid to respond when you tag `@droid` in:

- Issue comments
- Pull request comments
- Pull request reviews
- Issue descriptions and titles

**Triggers:**
- `issue_comment` - When a comment contains @droid
- `pull_request_review_comment` - When a PR review comment contains @droid
- `pull_request_review` - When a PR review body contains @droid
- `issues` - When an issue body or title contains @droid

**Use cases:**
- Ask Droid to implement features described in issues
- Request code changes in PR comments
- Get help understanding code in reviews

### Droid Review workflow

Provides automated code review on new pull requests.

**Triggers:**
- `pull_request` - When a PR is opened, reopened, or marked ready for review

**Use cases:**
- Automatic first-pass review on all PRs
- Catch common issues before human review
- Consistent review coverage across the team

## Setup steps after installation

After the `/install-github-app` workflow completes, you need to:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Review the pull request">
    A PR has been created in your repository with the workflow files. Review the changes.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Generate a Factory API key">
    Go to [https://app.factory.ai/settings/api-keys](https://app.factory.ai/settings/api-keys) and create a new API key.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add the secret to GitHub">
    In your repository settings, go to **Settings > Secrets and variables > Actions** and add a new repository secret:
    - **Name:** `FACTORY_API_KEY`
    - **Value:** Your generated API key
  </Step>

  <Step title="Merge the PR">
    Once the secret is configured, merge the workflow PR to enable Droid.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Permissions

### Repository admin permissions

For the smoothest setup, you should have admin access to the repository. If you don't have admin permissions, you'll see a warning but can still proceed. You may need a repository admin to:

- Approve the GitHub App installation
- Add the `FACTORY_API_KEY` secret
- Merge the workflow PR

### GitHub App permissions

The Factory Droid GitHub App requires these permissions:

- **Contents:** Read and write (to push workflow files and make code changes)
- **Pull requests:** Read and write (to create PRs and post reviews)
- **Issues:** Read and write (to respond to issue comments)
- **Actions:** Read (to monitor workflow runs)

## Tips and best practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Which workflows should I enable?">
    - **Start with @Droid only** if you want manual control over when Droid participates
    - **Enable both** for full automation with code review on every PR
    - **Droid Review alone** if you only want automated reviews without @droid mentions
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Troubleshooting preflight failures">
    | Error | Solution |
    |-------|----------|
    | GitHub CLI not installed | Install `gh` using the commands above |
    | Not logged in | Run `gh auth login` |
    | Missing permissions | Run `gh auth refresh -s repo,read:org` |
    | API access error | Check your internet connection and run `gh auth status` |
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Navigating the setup UI">
    - Press **Esc** to go back at any step
    - Press **Ctrl+C** to exit the entire flow
    - Use **arrow keys** to navigate options
    - Press **Space** to toggle workflow selection
    - Press **Enter** to confirm and continue
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Multiple repositories">
    Run `/install-github-app` separately for each repository you want to configure. The flow automatically detects the current repository from your git remote.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Example usage

```bash
cd my-project
droid

> /install-github-app
```

After completing the guided flow, Droid creates a PR with workflow files. Here's what the generated Droid Review workflow looks like:

<Accordion title="Generated Droid Review Workflow">
```yaml
name: Droid Code Review

on:
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, synchronize, reopened, ready_for_review]

concurrency:
  group: droid-review-${{ github.event.pull_request.number }}
  cancel-in-progress: true

permissions:
  pull-requests: write
  contents: read
  issues: write

jobs:
  code-review:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    timeout-minutes: 15
    if: github.event.pull_request.draft == false

    steps:
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
        with:
          fetch-depth: 0
          ref: ${{ github.event.pull_request.head.sha }}

      - name: Install Droid CLI
        run: |
          curl -fsSL https://app.factory.ai/cli | sh
          echo "$HOME/.local/bin" >> $GITHUB_PATH

      - name: Configure git identity
        run: |
          git config user.name "Droid Agent"
          git config user.email "droidagent@factory.ai"

      - name: Perform automated code review
        env:
          FACTORY_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.FACTORY_API_KEY }}
          GH_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
        run: |
          droid exec --auto high --model claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929 -f prompt.txt
```
