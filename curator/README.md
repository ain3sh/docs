# Curator

> Blazing fast CLI to curate web content as clean markdown

Curator fetches any webpage and converts it to clean markdown, perfect for storing as local context in your projects so AI agents don't have to repeatedly fetch the same information.

## Features

- 🎯 **Smart file naming** - Automatically uses webpage titles
- 📝 **Clean markdown** - Extracts main content, strips navs/headers
- 💾 **Intelligent caching** - Tracks fetched URLs to avoid duplicates
- ⚙️ **Zero config** - Interactive setup on first run
- 🔒 **Secure** - API key stored in `~/.config/curator/.env`

curate <url> --full                  # Include headers/navs/footers

```

### Getting an API Key

1. Visit [firecrawl.dev](https://firecrawl.dev)
2. Sign up for an account
3. Get your API key from the dashboard
4. Run `curate config` to set it up

## Output Format

Files are saved with frontmatter metadata:

```markdown
---
url: https://example.com/article
title: Getting Started with React
description: Learn React basics...
fetched: 2025-11-09T10:30:00Z
---

# Getting Started with React

[Clean markdown content...]
```

## Cache Management

Curator tracks fetched URLs in `~/.config/curator/manifest.json` to avoid duplicate fetches:

```json
{
  "https://example.com": {
    "filename": "example-domain.md",
    "title": "Example Domain",
    "fetched": "2025-11-09T10:30:00Z",
    "outputPath": "/path/to/context/example-domain.md",
    "hash": "abc123"
  }
}
```

## Why Curator?

When working with AI agents on projects, they often need to fetch documentation repeatedly. Curator solves this by:

1. **Pre-fetching docs** - Store them locally once
2. **Clean format** - Markdown is perfect for AI context
3. **Organization** - All docs in one place with metadata
4. **Speed** - No repeated network calls

## Examples

```bash
# Fetch API documentation
curate https://docs.firecrawl.dev/api-reference/v2-introduction

# Fetch blog posts for research
curate https://blog.example.com/post -o ./research/

# Fetch with custom name
curate https://react.dev/reference/react -n react-api-reference

# Check what you've fetched
curate list

# Re-fetch updated content
curate https://docs.example.com --refresh
```

## Development

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Build
npm run build

# Run locally
npm run dev -- <url>

# Link for global use
npm link
```
